    "        <h2>Explanation</h2>\n",
    "        <p>This interdisciplinary approach, blending neuroscience, physics, and systems theory, provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing spheroid data. It is a testament to the confluence of diverse scientific principles, from the biochemistry of neural tissue to the complex algorithms of signal processing, all converging to elucidate the dynamic behavior of cortical spheroids. The research into the optimal embedding dimension for phase space reconstruction of data from human cortical spheroids represents an interdisciplinary synthesis, uniting concepts from neuroscience, biochemistry, signal processing, nonlinear dynamics, and chaos theory. The application of the False Nearest Neighbors (FNN) algorithm is central to this endeavor, aiming to elucidate the complex, often hidden, dynamics within these biological systems. Through this approach, we seek to expose the underlying geometric structures embedded in the time-series data of cortical spheroids. At the heart of our method lies the principle of delay embedding, a concept integral to nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. This technique transforms one-dimensional time-series data into a higher-dimensional phase space, a process foundational in revealing the system’s true dynamical nature. This transformation is rooted in Takens' Theorem, a cornerstone in dynamical systems theory, which asserts that the full dynamical information of a system can be reconstructed from a single observable by creating its time-delayed copies. The theorem draws upon topology and differential geometry, providing a framework to explore the geometric and topological properties inherent in the dynamics of complex systems like cortical spheroids. The selection of embedding parameters, particularly the embedding dimension mm and delay ττ, is a delicate balance influenced by multiple factors. From a neuroscience perspective, it's about capturing the temporal dynamics of neural signals in their entirety, ensuring no critical information is lost in translation to the multidimensional space. In signal processing, this translates to retaining the integrity and richness of the original data, avoiding both information redundancy and loss. The embedding dimension mm determines the unfolded dimensionality of the attractor in phase space, crucial for accurately capturing the complexity and chaotic behavior of the spheroids' electrophysiological activity. The delay ττ must be sufficient to unfold the system's dynamics without introducing redundancy, echoing the principles of information theory, particularly Shannon entropy, in ensuring efficient data representation. The implementation of the FNN algorithm is an endeavor grounded in systems theory and cybernetics. It provides a robust method to differentiate between true dynamical neighbors and false projections resulting from an inadequate unfolding of the attractor in the reconstructed phase space. This comparative analysis of distances in successively higher dimensions resonates deeply with the principles of electrical physics and engineering, emphasizing the importance of signal integrity and noise discrimination. The FNN method is not merely a tool in signal processing; it's a bridge in systems theory that helps distinguish the true dynamics of a complex system from the potential artifacts introduced by lower-dimensional representations. The threshold RR in the FNN algorithm is pivotal, as it demarcates the boundary between true and false neighbors, aiding in the identification of an embedding dimension where the system's dynamics are adequately unfolded. In conclusion, our approach interlaces the advanced concepts of neuroscience, particularly the study of neural dynamics, with the mathematical rigor of nonlinear dynamics and the precision of signal processing. By employing the FNN algorithm within this multidisciplinary framework, we aim to advance our understanding of the dynamic behavior of human cortical spheroids, a pursuit that lies at the intersection of biology, mathematics, and engineering. This methodology not only provides a deepened understanding of cortical spheroid dynamics but also contributes significantly to the broader field of complex systems analysis.\n",

    "        <h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
    "        <p>Expanding our research to include the analysis of human cortical spheroids, we focus on optimizing the delay parameter for phase space reconstruction of electrophysiological signals. This crucial step ensures the preservation of the temporal structure in phase space, accurately reflecting the dynamical systems underlying the spheroids' activity. We employed Mutual Information (MI) analysis, offering a quantitative measure of statistical dependencies between time-lagged versions of the data.</p>\n",
    "        <h2>Mathematical Foundations</h2>\n",
    "        <p>Mutual information is calculated between the original signal \\( x(t) \\) and its delayed version \\( x(t+\\tau) \\). It is defined as:</p>\n",
    "        \\[ \\text{MI}(x(t); x(t+\\tau)) = \\sum_{x,x'} p(x, x') \\log\\left(\\frac{p(x, x')}{p(x)p(x')}\\right) \\]\n",
    "        <p>Here, \\( p(x, x') \\) is the joint probability distribution of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( x(t+\\tau) \\), and \\( p(x) \\) and \\( p(x') \\) are the marginal distributions. The minimization of MI indicates an optimal delay, reducing redundancy and revealing intrinsic dynamics.</p>\n",
    "        <p>Following the optimal delay determination, a <strong>delay embedding</strong> is conducted, transforming the one-dimensional data into a multidimensional phase space, crucial for exploring the spheroids' dynamics.</p>\n",
    "        \\[ X(t) = [ x(t), x(t-\\tau), x(t-2\\tau), \\ldots, x(t-(m-1)\\tau) ] \\]\n",
    "        <h2>Implementing Mutual Information for Delay Determination</h2>\n",
    "        <p>Utilizing Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) for mutual information, we identify the delay that minimizes MIC, ensuring a decorrelated and accurate phase space reconstruction, integral to dynamical analysis.</p>\n",
    "        <h2>Implementation Synopsis</h2>\n",
    "        <p>After loading the spheroid electrophysiological data, we computed mutual information across a range of delays for each sample. Subsampling was used to manage computational resources. The delay that minimized the mutual information was selected as optimal.</p>\n",
    "        <p>With the optimal delay identified, we performed delay embedding and generated 2D scatter plots to visualize the phase space structure, serving as qualitative validation and revealing the unfolding of the spheroids' dynamics.</p>\n",
    "        <h2>Data Visualization</h2>\n",
    "        <p>The phase space plots visualize the delay embedding, showing the spheroid data in 2D phase space. These plots illustrate the data's dynamical structure, revealing complex behavior over time.</p>\n",
    "        <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n",
    "        <p>This methodology provides a detailed approach for delay determination and embedding in phase space reconstruction. By utilizing mutual information for delay selection, we lay a robust foundation for revealing the intricate dynamical systems represented by spheroid data. The visualization and preservation of embedded data highlight the potential for advanced analysis of complex biological signals. At the core of this research are human cortical spheroids - miniature, simplified versions of the brain created from pluripotent stem cells. These spheroids exhibit neural activities and interactions akin to those in the human brain, making them an invaluable model for neuroscience research. From a biochemical viewpoint, these spheroids are a confluence of numerous signaling pathways, ionic fluxes, and metabolic processes, each contributing to the emergent properties observed in their electrophysiological patterns. Understanding these patterns requires a nuanced appreciation of both the biochemical milieu and the neural networks within these spheroids. The application of delay embedding and mutual information in our methodology is deeply rooted in signal processing and nonlinear dynamics. The complex signals emanating from cortical spheroids are not merely random noise; they are manifestations of the underlying neural activities. In nonlinear dynamics, these signals can be viewed as trajectories in a high-dimensional phase space, each trajectory representing a different state or mode of neural activity. The delay embedding process helps in reconstructing this phase space from time-series data, providing a window into the dynamical behavior of these biological systems. Chaos theory, a subset of nonlinear dynamics, is particularly relevant when studying complex systems like cortical spheroids. The seemingly erratic behavior observed in neural signals could be indicative of chaotic dynamics, which, contrary to being purely random, are deterministic but highly sensitive to initial conditions. Understanding this chaos requires a systems theory approach, where one looks at the spheroids as holistic entities whose behavior emerges from the interactions of their constituent parts. This perspective is crucial for deciphering the patterns and structures within the phase space. Finally, the principles of physics and chemistry are not to be overlooked. The electrical signals from the spheroids are essentially the result of ionic movements across neural membranes, governed by the laws of electrodynamics and chemical gradients. Moreover, the phase space reconstruction and subsequent analysis rely on mathematical and physical concepts to extract meaningful information from these biological signals. In conclusion, this expanded approach highlights the convergence of multiple scientific disciplines in the study of human cortical spheroids. By employing methods from neuroscience, biochemistry, signal processing, nonlinear dynamics, chaos theory, systems theory, materials science, electrical engineering, physics, and chemistry, we aim not only to unravel the complex dynamics of these miniaturized brain models but also to contribute significantly to the broader understanding of neural function and disorders.</p>\n",
