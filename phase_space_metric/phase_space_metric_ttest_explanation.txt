Phase Space Analysis Metric for Human Cortical Spheroids

Objective: To evaluate the learning and adaptive responses of human cortical spheroids to electrical stimulations.

Method Overview: Phase Space Analysis is a powerful technique often used in neuroscience to understand complex dynamical systems like brain tissue or, in this case, human cortical spheroids. This method involves analyzing the trajectory of a system in a multidimensional space (the phase space) where each dimension corresponds to one of the system's variables. For cortical spheroids, these variables could be various electrophysiological properties measured during and after stimulation.

Data Collection:

    Pre-Stimulation Data: Record baseline electrophysiological data from the cortical spheroids. This data serves as the control state of the spheroids before any learning or adaptation has occurred.
    Post-Stimulation Data: After applying electrical stimulations, record the corresponding electrophysiological responses. This data represents the state of the spheroids post-stimulation, potentially reflecting learning or adaptation.

Phase Space Construction:

    Variables Selection:
        Identify critical electrophysiological variables that capture the dynamics of cortical spheroids. These could include spike rate, amplitude, interspike intervals, local field potentials, or other relevant measures.
        Ensure that the selected variables are not only representative but also independent to avoid redundancy in the phase space. Consider applying dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA if the number of variables is large.

    Constructing the Phase Space:
        Map each observation (or time point) of your system into the phase space. This involves plotting each observation as a point in an N-dimensional space, where N is the number of selected variables.
        Utilize time-delay embedding if necessary, particularly if the system is expected to have underlying dynamics not captured by the directly measured variables. This involves creating lagged versions of your observations to unfold the dynamics in a higher-dimensional space.

    Trajectory Analysis:
        Plot the trajectory by connecting consecutive points in the phase space. This trajectory represents the dynamical evolution of the system over time.
        Analyze the trajectory for characteristics such as attractors, limit cycles, or chaotic behavior. These characteristics can provide insights into the stability and dynamic nature of the cortical spheroids.

    Quantitative Analysis:
        Quantify properties of the trajectory, such as Lyapunov exponents or fractal dimensions, to understand the system's stability and chaotic nature.
        Compare trajectories before and after stimulation to observe changes in dynamics, possibly indicative of learning or adaptation.
        
        For Those New to Phase Space Analysis:

    Understanding Phase Space:
        Imagine phase space as a way to visualize the behavior of a system (in this case, cortical spheroids) over time. Each variable you measure (like spike rate or amplitude) represents a dimension in this space.

    Selecting Variables:
        Choose measurements that you think best describe the behavior of your spheroids. For example, how often neurons fire (spike rate), how strong these signals are (amplitude), and how regular or irregular these signals are (frequency of oscillations).

    Creating the Phase Space:
        Each point in this space represents a snapshot of your spheroids' activity at a particular moment. For example, one point might represent a time when neurons are firing rapidly and strongly, while another might represent a time when they are quiet.

    Plotting the Trajectory:
        By connecting these points over time, you create a trajectory that shows how the activity of your spheroids changes. This trajectory can loop back on itself, spiral outwards, or form complex patterns, each illustrating different behaviors of the spheroids.

    Interpreting the Trajectory:
        The shape and pattern of the trajectory can tell you about the spheroids' behavior. For instance, if the trajectory settles into a loop, it might indicate a regular, repeating pattern of activity. If it forms a more complicated shape, this could suggest more complex or even chaotic behavior.

    Comparing Trajectories:
        By looking at how these trajectories change before and after you stimulate the spheroids, you can get clues about how they respond and possibly learn from the stimulation.

Metric Calculation:
    
        Trajectory Analysis for Learning Indicators:
        Examine the geometrical properties of the trajectories. Look for changes in shape, density, and orientation in the phase space that may occur due to electrical stimulation.
        Calculate quantitative measures such as Lyapunov exponents to assess the stability or chaotic nature of the trajectories. A significant change in these measures post-stimulation could indicate learning or adaptation.

    Distance Metrics Between Trajectories:
        Implement distance measures like Euclidean distance, dynamic time warping, or others relevant to multidimensional data to quantify the changes between pre- and post-stimulation trajectories.
        Analyze how the distance evolves over time. A convergence or divergence of trajectories can provide insights into the behavioral changes of the spheroids.

    Attractor Analysis:
        Investigate the presence of attractors – points or sets of points that the system tends to evolve towards. The emergence or alteration of attractors post-stimulation can signify a fundamental change in the system’s dynamics.
        Utilize methods like Poincaré maps or recurrence plots to identify and analyze these attractors.

    Statistical Analysis of Trajectories:
        Apply statistical tests to trajectory features to evaluate the significance of observed changes. This might involve comparing trajectory lengths, occupation densities, or other statistical properties before and after stimulation.
        
        For Those New to Phase Space Analysis:

    Understanding Trajectory Analysis:
        Think of a trajectory as a path drawn by the spheroids' behavior over time in a multidimensional space. Analyzing these paths helps us understand how the spheroids' behavior changes, especially in response to stimulation.

    Changes in Trajectory Patterns:
        Look for any new patterns or changes in the paths before and after stimulation. For example, if the path starts looping differently or takes a new shape post-stimulation, it might indicate that the spheroids are responding to the stimulation.

    Measuring Distance Between Trajectories:
        Imagine comparing two paths by measuring how far apart they are at different points in time. Changes in these distances can tell us if the spheroids' behavior is becoming more similar or more divergent after stimulation.

    Identifying New Patterns (Attractors):
        An attractor is like a pattern that the spheroids' behavior keeps coming back to. If new patterns emerge after stimulation, or if old ones change, it could suggest that the spheroids are learning or adapting.

    Quantifying Changes in Behavior:
        Use simple metrics like how long a path is, how dense it is (how many times it crosses a certain area), or how predictable it is. Comparing these metrics before and after stimulation can give a quantitative view of how the spheroids' behavior has changed.

    Statistical Comparison:
        Apply basic statistical techniques to compare the properties of the trajectories before and after stimulation. This could involve simple descriptive statistics like means and variances.

Statistical Analysis using Paired t-test:

    Preparation for t-test: Extract quantifiable metrics from the phase space analysis (e.g., trajectory divergence, mean distance from a baseline state) for both pre- and post-stimulation states.
    Paired t-test Application: Apply a paired t-test to these metrics to statistically determine if the observed changes in the phase space trajectories after stimulation are significant compared to the baseline. This test is appropriate as it compares two related groups (pre- and post-stimulation states of the same spheroids) and can highlight whether the stimulation leads to a significant change in the spheroids' electrophysiological behavior.

    Data Visualization and Analysis: The use of plotting functions like plot_df and plot_spike_event can be adapted to visualize the trajectories in the phase space. Such visualizations can help in understanding the dynamical behavior of the spheroids post-stimulation.

    Fine-Grained Data Retrieval: The approach to fetch spike events for specified time windows (df_spike_event_10s) can be used to gather detailed data required for analyzing the immediate response of spheroids to electrical stimulation, which is critical for phase space trajectory analysis.

    Raw Spike Analysis: The method to load and analyze raw spikes could provide insights into the minute changes in neuronal activity, which can be reflected in the phase space trajectories.

Conclusion:
A significant result from the paired t-test would indicate that the electrical stimulation has led to detectable changes in the cortical spheroids, suggesting learning or adaptation. This method allows for a nuanced understanding of how complex neuronal systems like cortical spheroids respond to external stimuli, potentially offering insights into the fundamental mechanisms of learning at the cellular and network levels.
